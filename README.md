# LinkedIn Publications Backup

Welcome to the repository where I keep a local copy of the posts and articles
I’ve shared on LinkedIn. Think of it as a personal archive—a place to stash
thoughts, drafts, and the occasional long‑form piece before (or after) they
appear on my profile.

If you’re curious about the original content, you can find me on LinkedIn at:
